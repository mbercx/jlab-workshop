# While editing code source files you can create an interative console attached to the file (Right Mouse Button -> Create Console for Editor), which can be used to run selected portions of code from the file. To do that, select the code to run (or just place the cursor on a certain line) and press Enter

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print('Hi there')
plt.plot([3, 2, 1])
